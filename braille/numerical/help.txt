Sharada braille writer is a text editor using a six key approach for producing print materials in different 
languages. It is written in python3 with gtk3 framework. It uses letters 
f, d, s, j, k, and l in the keyboard to represent 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the braille 
dots respectively. One can use different combinations of braille to produce text. For example key 'f'
will produce 'a', 'f' and 'd' will produce 'b' and 'f' and 'j' will produce 'c' and like. The combination of keys 
should be pressed and released together.
